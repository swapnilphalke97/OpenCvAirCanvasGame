In air canvas you can draw on the screen with only waiving your finger around in the air. Its actually a colour tracking project with a small color bead on the Finger.
I learned this from Aryan Verma(https://youtu.be/eHgvMAwfODw) and to his basic Air Canvas,  added virtual game , where if we touch boundry of rectanagle we lose.
